# Fix Outlook Wrong Unread Number Issue


Sometimes we can see unread numbers on inbox label, but can't actually find them.

Fix steps:

1. In the "Search Current Mailbox (Ctrl+E)" box, type: `read:no` and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
2. When it shows "Find More on Server" link, click it. Then the unread email(s) should appear.
